From _Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools_ by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman:
> The lexical analyzer is the first phase of a compiler. Its main task is to read
> the input characters and produce as output a sequence of tokens that the parser
> uses for syntax analysis.
